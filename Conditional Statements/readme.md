This is a project I made to help me solidify my lesson on conditional statements in Javascript and to provide a reference for future use. 

There are three identical questions with identical answers and identical responses to those answers. The difference is that each example uses a different conditional statement to achieve the same results.

The first one uses an 'if/else' statement. The second uses a switch statement, and the third uses a ternary operator.

The code for each section is displayed on-page for easy reference.
